Every source, file and link from my bootcamp documentation.

Here you will find all the sources and code referenced in my documentation and bootcamp.

## SPIFFS (tools/ESP32FS/tool/.jar)
basic structure for spiffs with esp32s2 in arduino ide. put the folder in the "Arduino" folder. (it's probably in your documents if you spammed next while installing arduino IDE)

## chatappV4.0-OLD
this was the first and oldest chatapp. recommended you don't use this. because it has a lot of bugs.
chatapp1 to 3 not included because they were prototypes, with only html and css, no javascript and completely no responsiveness.
chatapp4.0 has some responsiveness, but not complete

## chatappV5.0
this has an improved and working logon screen, responsive but doesnt scale up for mobile users. that will come in version 6. 
upgraded UI, new colors, scrollwheels, and a nice gradient

## cloudsevrer
this is just a basic nodejs express hosting code .. being hosted locally
